Tracked Barcode
===============

.. module:: scandit.datacapture.barcode.tracking
  :android-package: com.scandit.datacapture.barcode.tracking.data

.. class:: TrackedBarcode
  @objc@ SDCTrackedBarcode : NSObject
  :available: android=6.0, ios=6.0

  A barcode tracked over the course of multiple frames.

  The state of a :type:`TrackedBarcode` can be observed using a :type:`IBarcodeTrackingListener`.
  
  The :meth:`IBarcodeTrackingListener.OnSessionUpdated` callback will be invoked every time a new frame is processed and at least one of the following events took place:
  
  1. A track is established. 
  2. A track location has changed.
  3. A track is lost and can no longer be tracked.

  .. property:: TimeInterval DeltaTime { get; }
    @java@ core.TimeInterval DeltaTimeToPrediction { get; }
    :available: ios=6.0, android=6.0

    The time (in seconds) it will take the tracked barcode to move to the :prop:`PredictedLocation`. This value can be used to animate the predicted change of location of the tracked barcode.

  .. property:: core.Quadrilateral PredictedLocation { get; }
    :available: android=6.0, ios=6.0

    The location where the tracked barcode is predicted to be in :prop:`DeltaTime`. 
    
    .. warning::
    
      In case the feature is not licensed, a quadrilateral with all corners set to 0, 0 is returned.

  .. property:: bool ShouldAnimateFromPreviousToNextState { get; }
    :available: ios=6.0, android=6.0

     |True| if it's safe to animate from the current state to the next. As there are state transitions that do not guarantee a stable ordering of the location's corners you should always check this property before animating a location change.

  .. property:: int32 Identifier { get; }
    @objc@ @property (nonatomic, readonly) NSInteger identifier
    :available: ios=6.0, android=6.0

    The unique identifier for the tracked barcode. The identifier is unique for each barcode. The same identifier may be reused once the barcode is lost for another barcode.

  .. property:: barcode.Barcode Barcode { get; }
    :available: android=6.0, ios=6.0

    The barcode associated to this track.
