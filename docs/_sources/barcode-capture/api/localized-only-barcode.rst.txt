======================

.. module:: scandit.datacapture.barcode
  :android-package: com.scandit.datacapture.barcode.data

.. class:: LocalizedOnlyBarcode
  @objc@ SDCLocalizedOnlyBarcode : NSObject
  :available: android=6.0, ios=6.0, cordova=6.1

  A barcode that was only localized but not recognized yet. This means there is no data or symbology associated with it.

  .. property:: core.Quadrilateral Location { get; }
    :available: android=6.0, ios=6.0, cordova=6.1

    The location of the code. The coordinates are in image-space, meaning that the coordinates correspond to actual pixels in the image. For display, the coordinates need first to be converted into screen-space.

    The meaning of the values of :prop:`core.Quadrilateral.TopLeft` etc is such that the top left point corresponds to the top left corner of the barcode, independent of how the code is oriented in the image.
    
    .. warning::
    
      In case the feature is not licensed, a quadrilateral with all corners set to 0, 0 is returned.

    .. todo:: SDK-11002 add link to section describing coordinate conversions.

  .. property:: uint FrameId { get; }
    @javascript@ get frameID(): number
    :available: android=6.0, ios=6.0, cordova=6.1

    Id of the frame from which this barcode information was obtained.

  .. method:: string ToJson()
    @objc@ -(nonnull NSString *)JSONString
    :available: ios=6.1, android=6.1

    Returns the JSON representation of the localized only barcode.
