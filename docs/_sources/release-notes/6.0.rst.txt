|sdk| 6.0 Release Notes
=======================

.. module:: scandit.datacapture.core
  :hidden:

Version 6.0 marks the initial release of |sdk|. It is a major update over the 5.x Scandit SDK and introduces new APIs and additional features. This release is not compatible with 5.x and will require code changes in your application. Take a look at our :doc:`migration guide </migrate-to-6>` for how to upgrade your app from 5.x to 6.0 and newer.

|sdk| is available on Android and iOS.

New Features/Performance Improvements
-------------------------------------

* Modernized and modularized API for more fine-grained control and better extensibility for future data capture technologies.
* Improved use of multi core architectures of mobile devices with speedup of 2-3x depending on settings and number of cores.
* Considerably improved MatrixScan animation smoothness and accuracy on Android.
* Simplified interface for :doc:`configuring the scan area and code selection </scan-area>`.
* Improve recognition speed of direct part marking mode.
* Improved MatrixScan auto-focus stability on a wide range of rugged devices and low-end Android devices.

Behavioral Changes
------------------

This section contains a list of behavioral changes between 5.x and 6.0.

* The short 43 character legacy app keys supported in 4.x and 5.x have been deprecated and are not compatible with 6.0 anymore. Please contact support@scandit.com to get your new license keys.
* It is now an error to enable symbologies that are not supported by your app key. In 5.x, these symbologies would silently be disabled without any warning.
* EAN13 and UPCA used to be separate symbologies in Scandit SDK 5.x, but are now merged into one symbology called :enum:`EAN13/UPCA <barcode.Symbology.Ean13Upca>`.
* Barcode capture: The default :prop:`code duplicate filter <barcode.BarcodeCaptureSettings.CodeDuplicateFilter>` has been changed from 500ms to 0ms, meaning that codes that are scanned are reported every frame.

Bugfixes in |sdk| 6.0.1
-----------------------

.. eager-ifconfig:: platform == 'ios'

  * Fixed a bug that caused the last frame of the previous camera to be shown when changing to a different camera.
  * Fixed rendering issues when multiple :type:`DataCaptureView <core.ui.DataCaptureView>` instances are created and reused
  * Fixed underlying issue that caused "... after fill simple" error messages.

.. eager-ifconfig:: platform == 'android'
