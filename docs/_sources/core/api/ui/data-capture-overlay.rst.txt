Data Capture Overlay

  A capture mode overlay is the UI counterpart of capture modes and visualizes the recognition process in the graphical user interface. Overlays highlight objects such as identified barcodes on top of the preview. Overlays may add UI elements to guide the user, such as view finders.

  Capture mode overlays are added to a :type:`DataCaptureView` through :meth:`DataCaptureView.AddOverlay` and removed again through :meth:`DataCaptureView.RemoveOverlay`. Overlays are associated to the data capture modes they require when they are constructed.

  Overlays are restricted to the set of overlays provided by the |sdk|, it is not possible for customers to |implement| this |interface| and provide custom overlays. This |interface| does not expose any methods or properties, it just serves as a tag for different overlays.
